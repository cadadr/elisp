;;; Commentary:
;;
;; forecast.el generates a _weather forecast report_ and displays it
;; in a buffer.  It uses data from Dark Sky (http://darksky.net), and
;; thus one needs to acquire an api key from them in order to use this
;; package.  They allow 1000 requests a day in their free plan, which
;; should be enough for any user.
;;
;; See Installation section for installation and setup instructions.
;;
;; Report bugs to the Issues page in the Github repo:
;;
;; https://github.com/cadadr/elisp/issues
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; See also «Example configuration».
;;
;; forecast.el is available on Melpa with the package name `forecast'.
;;
;; Otherwise, put the forecast.el file somewhere in your path, then
;; `require' it.   Then set these variables either in your
;; configuration, or via the customisation group `forecast':
;;
;; `calendar-latitude'      Latitude of your location        float
;; `calendar-longitude'     Longitude of your location       float
;; `forecast-api-key'       The API key from Dark Sky        string
;; `calendar-location-name' Name of your location/city       string
;; `forecast-language'      Language to use                  symbol
;; `forecast-units'         Units standard to use            symbol
;;
;; Only the first three variables above are mandatory.  The first four have
;; *non-sane* defaults, and if `forecast-api-key' is absent, this program
;; will not run.
;;
;; See the documentation for these variables for more detail.
;;
;; The API key can be obtained via registering oneself through their
;; developer website:
;;
;; https://darksky.net/dev/
;;
;; See also the docstring for the face `forecast-moon-phase', which
;; governs the face for the moon phase visualisation.  Most fonts will
;; not have defined the necessary characters, thus one may need to
;; install a special font, e.g. Quivira (http://quivira-font.com/).
;;
;; Then on, you may run the command `forecast' to get the forecast
;; buffer.  The forecast buffer uses `org-level-*' faces,  so it will
;; look like your org files.  It is called «*Weather Forecast*».

;;; Example configuration:
;;
;; (require 'forecast)
;; (setq calendar-latitude 41.168602
;;       calendar-longitude 29.047024
;;       calendar-location-name "İstanbul, Türkiye"
;;       forecast-api-key "<deduced>")
;;
;; Or, for the privacy of the API key:
;;
;; (require 'forecast)
;; (setq calendar-latitude 41.168602
;;       calendar-longitude 29.047024
;;       calendar-location-name "İstanbul, Türkiye"
;;       forecast-city "İstanbul")
;;
;; (load (locate-user-emacs-file "forecast-api-key.el"))
;;
;; And in the file ~/.emacs.d/forecast-api-key.el:
;;
;; (setq forecast-api-key "<deduced>")
;;

;;; Usage:
;;
;; There are 3 keybindings:
;;
;; g      Refresh the forecast.  Will re-download data.
;; q      Bury the buffer.
;; C-u q  Kill the buffer.
;;
;; Two contemporaneous instances of the program *will not* run
;; correctly, as global state is used to store data.
;;
;; The buffer is made up of these elements:
;;
;; - At the top, the title, details of location, last update time
;;
;; - Temperature and summary
;;
;; - Apparent temperature (Feels like ...) and detailed summary
;;
;; - Pressure in ATMs, humidity percentage, wind speed and direction
;;   from which wind comes. If available, visibility distance.
;;
;; - Graphic showing hourly temperature changes for the upcoming 24
;;   hours.
;;
;; - Summary information for upcoming seven days, by default in a
;;   compact graphical format.  This format was added in v0.5.0, set
;;   the variable `forecast-old-ui' to a non-nil value to return to
;;   the old UI.
;;
;; - Link to the service provider.
