;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Paper is a  little, minimal emacs theme that is  meant to be simple
;; and consistent.
;;
;; It  was first  intended  to resemble  the look  of  paper, but  has
;; diverged from  that objective.   Still, though,  I keep  calling it
;; Paper, as I like that name.
;;
;; Paper  uses a  small colour  palette  over all  the elements.   Org
;; headings  are  specially  treated  with a  palette  of  equidistant
;; colours.  The colours  and heading font sizes  are calculated using
;; base and factor values which can be edited.  See source.
;;
;; It's most adapted for ELisp-Org users, as I'm one such user, though
;; it  works fine  with Markdown,  Textile, Python,  JavaScript, Html,
;; Diff, Magit, etc.
;;
;;; Installation:
;;
;; Install it into a directory that's in the `custom-theme-load-path'.
;; I recommend  that you  put that directory  also in  `load-path', so
;; that you can `require' the  `paper-theme'.  Then adapt this snippet
;; to your configuration.
;;
;;   ;; Not necessary, but silences flycheck errors for referencing free
;;   ;; variables.
;;   (require 'paper-theme)
;;   ;; It's not necessary to modify these variables, they all have sane
;;   ;; defaults.
;;   (setf paper-paper-colour 'paper-parchment ; Custom background.
;;         paper-tint-factor 45)      ; Tint factor for org-level-* faces
;;   ;; Activate the theme.
;;   (load-theme 'paper t)
;;
;;; Customisation:
;;
;; It is possible to modify the  base font size and the scaling factor
;; for `org-level-faces' via  the variables `paper-base-font-size' and
;; `paper-font-factor' respectively.
;;
;; The factor  for org-level-*  colours are also  configurable, adjust
;; the variable `paper-tint-factor'.
;;
;; Various background colours  are provided, see the  docstring of the
;; variable `paper-paper-colour'  in order to  find out how  to switch
;; them.   You  can add  your  custom  colour for  background  without
;; modifying this module:
;;
;;   (push (list 'my-bgcolour "#000000") paper-colours-alist)
;;   (setf paper-paper-colour 'my-bgcolour)
;;
;; The following snippet will modify org-level-* faces so that initial
;; stars in  org headings are  hidden and  a Sans-serif font  is used.
;; Because  the combination  of heading  font sizes  and colours  make
;; levels  obvious, it  may be  considered superfluous  to have  stars
;; indicating depth:
;;
;;   (setq org-hide-leading-stars nil)
;;   (set-face-attribute
;;    'org-hide nil
;;    :height 0.1 :weight 'light :width 'extracondensed)
;;   (dolist (face org-level-faces)
;;     (set-face-attribute
;;      face nil
;;      :family "Sans Serif"))
;;

(require 'cl-lib)

;;; Code from hexrgb.el:
;; On 25 Dec 2018 I was informed that Melpa was about to drop support
;; for Emacswiki packages, which includes hexrgb.el too.  This means
;; that I needed to remove the dependency on the package, so I include
;; here the functions needed by paper-theme from that package.  Below,
;; I reproduce information on copyright and some other things from the
;; version I have of it:
