;;; Commentary:

;; Variable-pitch support for org-mode.  This minor mode enables
;; ‘variable-pitch-mode’ in the current Org-mode buffer, and sets some
;; particular faces up so that they are are rendered in fixed-width
;; font.  Also, indentation, list bullets and checkboxes are displayed
;; in monospace, in order to keep the shape of the outline.

;;; Installation:

;; Have this file somewhere in the load path, then:

;;   (require 'org-variable-pitch)
;;   (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-variable-pitch-minor-mode)

;;; Setup:

;; org-variable-pitch.el (hereafter, OVP) can be set up in two
;; methods, the new method introduced in v2.0, and the old way which
;; was the initial method.

;;;; New set up method:

;; With v2.0 a new function, ‘org-variable-pitch-setup’ has been
;; added, which is means to be added to the ‘after-init-hook’ in order
;; to set up a sensible default configuration for OVP.  In order to
;; use this method, you can simply add the following to your
;; ‘user-init-file’:

;;   (require 'org-variable-pitch)
;;   (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'org-variable-pitch-setup)

;; If you desire finer control, however, you might instead configure
;; OVP as follows:

;;  (require 'org-variable-pitch)
;;  (set-face-attribute 'org-variable-pitch-fixed-face nil
;;                      :family "My Custom Font Mono")
;;  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-variable-pitch--enable)

;; At the time I’m writing this, the above snippet is essentially
;; equivalent to what ‘org-variable-pitch-setup’ does, but that
;; function might get improved over time.  I’ll try to keep the
;; documentation in sync with it, but it’s recommended that you use
;; the setup function instead.

;;;; Old setup method:

;; The old way involved setting a variable-pitch font by hand and
;; adding ‘org-variable-pitch-minor-mode’ to ‘org-mode-hook’.

;; Because this method of setup is obsolete, it’s not documented here,
;; but OVP should still work fine with old-style configurations.  You
;; can still modify ‘org-variable-pitch-fixed-face’ (the new name of
;; ‘org-variable-pitch-face’, which is obsoleted) and have your
;; configurations stick though, which was not possible before v2.0.

;;; Configuration:

;; There are a couple variables and faces you can use to configure how
;; OVP behaves.  These can be modified through the Emacs’
;; customisation facility via

;;   M-x customize-group RET org-variable-pitch RET

;; or manually, in your ‘user-init-file’.  It’s advisable that you
;; consult the documentation of each variable with ‘describe-variable’
;; and each face with ‘describe-face’.

;;;; ‘org-variable-pitch-fixed-face’ (face):

;;   This face is applied to parts of the buffer that OVP renders in
;;   fixed pitch, i.e. monospace fonts.  These include the space
;;   characters on the left edge of the buffer (indentation), list
;;   bullets, checkboxes, and optionally, leading asterixes of the
;;   headline (see below).

;;   By default, ‘org-variable-pitch-setup’ sets the ‘:family’
;;   attribute of this face to that of the ‘default’ face.  Pre-v2.0
;;   this was achieved via setting the ‘org-variable-pitch-fixed-font’
;;   to a desired font, which can still be used (see below), but we’ve
;;   obsoleted that method in favour of this new style of
;;   configuration in order to allow customising this face.

;;   This face replaces ‘org-variable-pitch-face’, which is made into
;;   an obsolete alias (i.e. still usable, but obsoleted).

;;;; ‘org-variable-pitch-fixed-font’ (variable):

;;   Obsolete since v2.0. Please configure
;;   ‘org-variable-pitch-fixed-face’ instead.

;;;; ‘org-variable-pitch-fixed-faces’ (variable):

;;   Apart from applying a face to the indentation and other aligned
;;   parts of an Org mode buffer to fix alignment issues, OVP also
;;   modifies the appearance of some other elements of the buffer so
;;   that everything appears tidy and aligned when
;;   ‘variable-pitch-mode’ is enabled.

;;   This variable contains a list of the faces that are to be
;;   modified in order to achive that.  You can extend this list with
;;   the names of faces you want to keep in fixed pitch, tho the
;;   default is aimed to be fairly comprehensive.

;;;; ‘org-variable-pitch-fontify-headline-prefix’ (variable):

;;   When this variable is non-nil, the leading asterixes of Org mode
;;   headlines are configured to appear in fixed pitch too.

function somewhere after you set up ‘default’ face.

A nice place to call this function is from within
‘after-init-hook’:

Alternatively, you might want to manually set up the attributes

calling avoid this function, add ‘org-variable-pitch-minor-mode’
to ‘org-mode-hook’ manually, and set up the face however you
