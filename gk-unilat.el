;;; Commentary:

;; This is the Universal Latin Emacs Input Method.

;; It  aims to  provide  comprehensive support  for typing  characters
;; found in  different European versions  of the Latin alphabet,  in a
;; unified, predictable way.

;; See [ C-h I unilat-gk ] for a comprehensive listing of keymaps, but
;; also the definitions below as they are logically grouped.

;; See  `gk-unilat-languages' for  a list  of intentionally  supported
;; languages.

;; Contributions are welcome:

;;   $ cp gk-unilat.el gk-unilat.el.orig
;;   edit gk-unilat.el...
;;   $ diff -u gk-unilat.el.orig gk-unilat.el > gk-unilat.el.patch
;;   review the patch.
;;   mail me the patch.

;; Include in  your mail a description  of the changes and  why.  Make
;; sure that the  changes fit in with the patterns  already used here.
