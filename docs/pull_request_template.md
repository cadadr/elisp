Hi, thanks a lot for considering to contribute to this project!

Please check if you’ve done the following:

1. Write your patches against the `devel` branch, and send your pull
   request against it.  `master` is for releases.

2. Prefix your commit messages’ subject lines with the file name:

   ```
   file.el: the commit message goes here
   
   Optionally further document your changes.
   ```

   Do **not** end the first line with punctuation, and do **not**
   capitalise right after the **colon**.

3. In your pull request, document:
   - What is the problem your changes solve? **or**
   - What is the new feature your changes add?
   - How does the changes address the problem / implement the feature?
     (Unless it is obvious from the patch.)

Thanks a lot for your cooperation!
